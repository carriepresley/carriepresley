Hey, what's up? I'm Carrie.

I'm a recovering left brain focused, corporate accountant, and high school mathematics teacher.

After years of analyzing and calculating numbers in my day job, I was left to compartmentalize my creativity outside of work. Through a unique journey of professional experiences, I'm finally weaving together my perfect tapestry of problem solving with rebellious, wild creations. Or sometimes just changing a font with CSS, but whatevs.

As a self-taught software developer, I'm busting my a$& to break into tech and I'm sharing my experiences through different mediums. I'm stoked your here, holla anytime!
