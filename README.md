Hey, what's up? I'm Carrie.

I'm recovering from my left brain only driven career. 

After years of analyzing and calculating numbers in my day jobs as a corporate accountant and math teacher, I was left to compartmentalize my creativity outside of work. Through a unique journey of professional experiences, I'm finally weaving together a tapestry of problem-solving with rebellious, wild creations. Or sometimes just finding new ways to iterate or jazzing the font in CSS, but whatevs.

As a self-taught software developer, I'm sharing my journey into the tech industry. I'm Carrie Presley on YouTube, social media platforms, and... in real life.  Let's connect!
