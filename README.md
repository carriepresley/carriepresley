# Hey, what's up? I'm Carrie.

The the number-crunching, tech-swooning, mistake-making, always-learning, creator and rebel to the norm.

While navigating through my professional experiences in corporate accounting and math education, I was constantly expanding on current software and creatively experimenting with technology.

As a self-taught software engineer, I can put together my wide range of skills from corporate tax returns to teaching algebraic functions through rap music, building projects and playing with new tools.

2021 is the year I get a full-time job as a software engineer! Follow along on YouTube, TikTok, Insta...whatever's your jam. I'm Carrie Presley everywhere online and in real life.

Good vibes your way!
