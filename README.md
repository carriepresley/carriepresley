What's up? I'm Carrie. I wear a lot of hats, literally... and figuratively. 
I majored in Accounting, became a co-owner of a sales agency, and then took a dip in education. From my experiences, the one thing that has always fed my soul, creating with technology.  Software development, content creation, and telling a story through different mediums fires me up! Well, that and coffee...and rap music....and yoga.

Currently learning React and polishing some Javascript, CSS, and HTML while creating my portfolio at [carriepresley.com](https://carriepresley.com).

Holla. Let's connect!
